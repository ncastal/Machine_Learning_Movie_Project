Prerequisites
While working on the project the tools we used were Python pandas, Visual Studio for the Javascript and HTML portion. In Pandas we had to import certain libraries such as beautiful soup, data frames, etc to import, manipulate, and export data. We also had to import libraries for the machine learning components 


Give examples
Installing
Everything was ran on the virtual environment in anaconda (source activate pythondata)

The machine learning part is a test to see if a review entered in by the user is a positive review or negative based on previous reviews given.

After pooling all the information needed we put together a css page and used bootstrap to generate a clean visually represented webpage for front end users to use. We used AWS to upload all data allowing a user to download entire data if needed for further analysis.
